# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

            Full automated suite in /app/backend_test.py executed against the external

              * Happy-path CRUD: create → recent → list-by-target → patch → delete (incl. author-only 403s)
              * Vote toggle: first call +1, second call from same WID toggles back to 0, voters list updated
              * Flag threshold: 3 distinct WIDs flip hidden=true; default GET excludes; ?include_hidden=true includes
              * Validation: bad target_type → 400, content <10 / >1000 chars → 422, WID violating ^[A-Z0-9]{4,8}$ → 400
              * 404s on vote/flag of unknown contribution_id
              * sort=top / recent / trending all produce expected ordering; limit param respected; sort=banana → 422
              * Edge case: no title + no author_name → defaults applied (title=None, author_name="Anonymous Wanderer")

            Refactored the 437 KB monolithic astrolabe.html into a tiny ~31 KB cinematic
            launcher + 3 lazy-loaded chunks (CSS / body HTML / engine.js, ~423 KB total).
            Hybrid hosting support added: launcher reads /api/static/config.js for an
            optional apiBase, then installs a fetch() wrapper that transparently routes
            /api/lore/* /api/saves/* /api/status/* to the remote backend while keeping
            /api/static/* on the same origin. Verified end-to-end with the launcher
            served from a different origin (port 7777) and the API on the live backend:
            game booted, /api/saves returned 200 from cross-origin, /api/static stayed
            local. Export script at backend/scripts/export_dist.py produces /app/dist
            (22 files, 5.6 MB) with _redirects / _headers / netlify.toml / vercel.json
            pre-configured for drag-and-drop deploy to Netlify / Cloudflare Pages /
            Vercel / GitHub Pages.

            Wanderer ID auto-generated and persisted. Community section appended below
            every databank's auto-generated lore. Saves modal opens from pause menu.
            Verified via screenshot tool: contributions appear, saves create+list works,
            voting hits backend (200 OK), mobile full-sheet styling applied.

      Please test the Phase D backend endpoints listed under `backend.tasks`. Focus areas:
        1. CRUD happy paths for both /api/lore/* and /api/saves/*
        2. Validation errors:
           - target_type outside the allowed set
           - content shorter than 10 chars or longer than 1000
           - bad WID (must match ^[A-Z0-9]{4,8}$ uppercase)
        3. Vote idempotency — same WID voting twice should TOGGLE (un-vote)
        4. Flag threshold — once 3 distinct WIDs flag a contribution, it should set hidden=true
           and disappear from default queries (but appear with ?include_hidden=1 on lore).
        5. Author-only edit/delete — non-author should get 403.
        6. Sort params (trending/recent/top) should work and respect limit.
        7. Test edge case: empty event_history on saves, no description on saves, no title on lore.
      DB is local Mongo via existing MONGO_URL env. UUIDs as `id` field (not Mongo _id).
      You do NOT need to test the existing astrolabe HTML/PWA serving — those are stable.
